# PNPM

A "Fast, disk space efficient package manager" - https://pnpm.io/

With Pnpm you can "Save disk space and boost installation speed", as it "allows you to share dependencies of the same version across projects".

But can it be used in a shared/concurrent environment, such as in Continuous Integration agents?

## Versions

Tested with :
 - MacOs 10.14.6
 - pnpm version 6.2.3
 - Docker Desktop 3.3.1

## Goal

Test if multiple Docker containers can read/update the Virtual Store simultaneously, without corrupting it.

## Prerequisite

You will need Bash/Docker/Git installed on your machine.

## Local setup

On your local machine:

- Clone this repo.
- Create an empty folder to accommodate the shared Virtual Store:

`mkdir -p /tmp/.pnpm-store-initial`

## Scenario 1 : Install three different sets of packages in parallel

Each folder (parallel_1, parallel_2, parallel_3) contain a different package.json file : most of the dependencies are common among it and some are unique to each one.

_Expected behavior_ : Should install packages on the shared Virtual Store (/tmp/.pnpm-store-initial) without corrupting it.

### Start the new Containers and Setup Pnpm on it

```
bash ./setup.sh parallel_1 &
bash ./setup.sh parallel_2 &
bash ./setup.sh parallel_3 &

```

### Trigger packages installation on the Containers in parallel using Pnpm

```
docker exec parallel_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i" &
sleep 15
docker exec parallel_2 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i" &
sleep 15
docker exec parallel_3 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i" &

```

At the end you should see something similar to the bellow, for each container:

```

dependencies:
+ @hapi/joi 17.1.1 deprecated
+ aws-sdk 2.897.0
+ bluebird 3.7.2
+ coffee-script 1.12.7 deprecated
+ date-fns 2.21.1
+ lodash 4.17.21
+ moment 2.29.1
+ pino 6.11.3
+ request 2.88.2 deprecated
+ uuid 8.3.2

```

### Check if the application is working

Run on each one of the 3 containers:

`docker exec parallel_1 /bin/sh -c "node /app/src/index.js"`

The output should be similar to:

```

{
NODE_VERSION: '14.16.1',
HOSTNAME: '44b2cfd34975',
YARN_VERSION: '1.22.5',
HOME: '/root',
PATH: '/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin',
PWD: '/'
}
^C

```

## Scenario 2 : Install three different sets of packages in parallel

Ps: run the command at "Clean up" and "Local setup" before executing this scenario.

Each folder (parallel_1 and parallel_2) contain a different package.json file : most of the dependencies are common among it and some are unique to each one.

_Expected behavior_ : Should install packages on the shared Virtual Store (/tmp/.pnpm-store-initial) without corrupting it.

### Start the new Containers and Setup Pnpm on it

```
bash ./setup.sh parallel_1 &
bash ./setup.sh parallel_2 &

```

### Trigger packages installation on the Containers in parallel using Pnpm

```
docker exec parallel_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i" &
docker exec parallel_2 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i" &
```

At the end you should see something similar to scenario 1.

### Check if the application is working

Similar to scenario 1.

## Scenario 3 : Install a third different set of packages by itself

Expected behavior : Should reuse packages already installed on the shared Virtual Store and add the new requirements.

### Start the new Containers and Setup Pnpm on it

```
bash ./setup.sh standalone_1

```

### Trigger packages installation on the Container

```
docker exec standalone_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i"
```

You should find one line similar to:

`Progress: resolved 200, reused 52, downloaded 148, added 200, done`

That shows that 52 packages were reused and another 148 new packages were downloaded.

### Check if the application is working

Similar to scenario 1.

## Scenario 4 : Repeat the installation of the third set of packages

Expected behavior : Should reuse all packages already installed on the shared Virtual Store.

### Start the new Containers and Setup Pnpm on it

```
bash ./setup.sh standalone_2

```

### Trigger packages installation on the Container

```
docker exec standalone_2 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i"
```

You should find one line similar to:

`Progress: resolved 200, reused 200, downloaded 0, added 200, done`

That shows that 200 packages were reused and no new packages were downloaded.

### Check if the application is working

Similar to scenario 1.

## Findings

### Scenario 1 : Empty Virtual Store and Three containers running

ðŸš¨ When the Virtual Store is empty (new server/agent) and we have 3 containers running in parallel, at least one of it will fail with an error similar to:

```
ERRORâ€‰ EPERM: operation not permitted, open '/.pnpm-store/v3/files/1e/41f385cc153c21c206dd0849f0d4660b119e8782ab1b5d6b91c52bea0dab256c5c3ff0759a19a59285eebc9522de4a326614f5ddf9b2d6ae7015e78566f7c9'
```

This is a extreme case: the chances of 3 installation process being running in parallel with an empty Virtual Store are very remote.

Adding an 'pause' of 15s between the executions avoids the issue.

An workaround would be implementing a simple 'retry' strategy such as:

```
retry() { eval "$*" || eval "$*" || eval "$*"}
retry docker exec parallel_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /app; pnpm i"

```

### Scenario 2 : Empty Virtual Store and two containers running

âœ… Works without issue.

### Scenario 3 : Existing Virtual Store and new packages required.

âœ… Works without issue.

### Scenario 4 : Existing Virtual Store and no new packages required.

âœ… Works without issue.

## Clean up

`docker kill parallel_1 parallel_2 parallel_3 standalone_1 standalone_2`

`docker container rm parallel_1 parallel_2 parallel_3 standalone_1 standalone_2`

`rm -Rf /tmp/.pnpm-store-initial`

## Next steps

Share the same Virtual Store in a CI agent and run multiple pipelines simultaneously.
